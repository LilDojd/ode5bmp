# BMP Image Reader and Writer in Rust

This is an educational project for [ODE5](https://www.0de5.net/stimuli/a-reintroduction-to-programming/memory/binary-formats-through-bitmap-images).

Features:

- Reading uncompressed 24-bit BMP files
- Writing uncompressed 24-bit BMP files

The code was written at the kitchen-table and I did not put much effort into the API and readability, so beware.
